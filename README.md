# ABOUT PROJECT
Since Twitter is one of the most comprehensive sources of live, public conversation worldwide, this project uses the dataset containing the tweets related to people's opinions on 
National Education Policy 2020. This program will be capable of parsing the tweets fetched from twitter and understanding the textâ€™s sentiments, like its polarity and subjectivity.
This project aims to figure out the general opinion on NEP 2020 and which may be used to make better strategies and plan for the future.  
We will be using various supervised learning algorithms and apply the best fit to train our model.
